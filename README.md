# log4j-CVE-2021-44228-workaround
This project provides a general purpose workaround for the log4j CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability, which can be used in case you do not have the alternative in short term to re-build your respective project or to patch the log4j-core jars.

The idea behind it is quite simple:  We force the class loader to load an "empty" version of JndiLookup" class using java runtime "-Xbootclasspath/a" option.
Therefore the whole workaround only consits of this single class "org.apache.logging.log4j.core.lookup.JndiLookup.java" and it has no other dependencies.

There is a pom.xml as well for cenvenience to compile and jar it via Maven, but you can also do the sam simply using your preferred JDK, using "javac" and "jar" commands.

Note that this  empty version of "JndiLookup" class cannot be compatible to the original log4j2 implementation because this would fail in certain class loading situations.

When applying the workaround you would see the following message:

	"WARN JNDI lookup class is not available because this JRE does not support JNDI. 
	JNDI string lookups will not be available, continuing configuration. 
	Ignoring java.lang.ClassCastException: class org.apache.logging.log4j.core.lookup.JndiLookup"

Log4j2 will continue working without problems never the less, just without using any JNDI lookup - there we go - JNDI lookup has been disabled!

Once you have compiled the class and created the jar file just add the "-Xbootclasspath/p" option at the beginning of your java command and point to the directory where you have placed the jar file (e.g. log4j-workaround-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar). See the proof of concept section for some example how to do this.

The java command could be one launching anything (Weblgic, Tomcat, fat jar built by spring, ...).


Proof of concept
you can ignore the following if you are just interested in the workaraound but not how to check if it really works.

to validate the approach I have added a "POC" folder which holds another maven project.  I didn't want to use any unit testing but rather stay close to production set-ups which use ecplicit command line launching of fat jars or a container launch as the Tomcat one I have validated it with. 
It holds two classes, "POC.java" to test the workaround on command line and "POCServlet.java" to test the same in an application server.

Both scenarios try to log "${jndi:ldap://localhost/test}", because of which log4j would try to connect to ldap on your local host without the workaround applied and fail the same with connection refused..

To run the commandline POC  (once you have built it in Maven):
- Go to the "target\log4j-workaround-1.0-SNAPSHOT\WEB-INF" directory in there and run (if you are on a Windows command line):

	java -Xbootclasspath/a:..\\..\\..\\..\target\\log4j-workaround-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -classpath classes;lib\\* com.github.grimch.log4j_workaround.poc.POC

To run run the POC with Tomcat:
- First deploy the "log4j-workaround-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war" into the tTomcat "webapps" directory.
- Rather than modifiying the java command just set the "CATALINA_OPTS" environment repectively:
- Set CATALINA_OPTS=-Xbootclasspath/a:<path-to-log4j-workaround-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar>
- Then start tomcat, e.g. using "catalina start".
- Open url http://localhost:8080/log4j-workaround-1.0-SNAPSHOT/POC in your browser.
- Check your terminal or catalina.out for the "WARN JNDI lookup class is not available ..." message.
